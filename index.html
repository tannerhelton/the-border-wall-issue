              A border guard of a country is a national security agency that
              performs border security, i.e., enforces the security of the
              country's national borders. Some of the national border guard
              agencies also perform coast guard (as in Germany or Ukraine) and
              rescue service duties.

              Typical tasks of a Border Guard are:
              <ul>
                <li>Controlling and guarding a nation's borders</li>
                <li>Controlling border crossing persons, vehicles, and travel documents</li>
                <li>Preventing illegal border crossing of persons, vehicles, cargoes and other goods</li>

              The Mexico–United States barrier is a series of vertical barriers along the Mexico–United States border aimed at preventing illegal crossings from Mexico into the United States. The barrier is not one contiguous structure, but a discontinuous series of physical obstructions variously classified as "fences" or "walls".
              <br><br>
Between the physical barriers, security is provided by a "virtual fence" of sensors, cameras, and other surveillance equipment used to dispatch United States Border Patrol agents to suspected migrant crossings. As of January 2009, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it had more than 580 miles (930 km) of barriers in place. The total length of the continental border is 1,954 miles (3,145 km).

The concept for the Trump wall was first developed by campaign advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone in summer 2014 as a memorable talking point Trump could use to tie his business experience as a builder and developer to his anti-immigration policy proposals. The wall was first positively received by conservative activists in January 2015 at the Iowa Freedom Summit hosted by Citizens United and Steve King, as well as two days later on conservative morning show Fox & Friends. The idea was repeated at his June 2015 announcement speech for his 2015–2016 presidential campaign, along with a claim that Mexico would pay for it, and has been further repeated many times since.

              The Border Patrol utilizes a variety of equipment and methods, such as electronic sensors placed at strategic locations along the border, to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries. Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, aircraft, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Air surveillance capabilities are provided by unmanned aerial vehicles.

              The United States Border Patrol (USBP) is the United States Customs and Border Protection's federal law enforcement arm within the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The USBP is the armed and uniformed federal police that secure the borders of the United States by detecting and preventing illegal aliens, terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States, and prevent illegal trafficking of people and contraband.
<br><br>
With 19,437 agents, the Border Patrol is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States. For fiscal year 2017, Congress enacted a budget of $3,805,253,000 for the Border Patrol
